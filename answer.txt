- Why nodejs is using require instead of import?
	react has ES6 from babel
	but node still has ES5
	Babel: a package that translates ES6 and above syntax to ES5 code.


	that's why node.js only uses require and not import.

- What are the different ways/options to move from require
 	to import?
	 update to version 14. + in nodejs
	 and add 
	 "type": "module", in the package.json

- Change the notes app to use import & export instead of 
	require and module.exports

import chalk from 'chalk';
import yargs from 'yargs';

we must change every require to import?
we must export default in files we want to import 
add to package.json this entry:
  "type": "module",
